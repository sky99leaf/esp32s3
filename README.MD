at time of writing, this folder has 2 copies of wifi scan demo for esp32s3
Both use "platformIO", not "esp-idf".  

Notes:  
* using platformIO with vscode in windows: never got it to work.   
  probably because notbody uses it.  Using WSL (windows system for linux) did
  not work either for platformIO, and lots of error messages.  
* in vscode/platformIO, need to point platformIO to one of the above projects, using filesystem location.  
* in vscode/github, it points to the root folder of the 2 projects.  
* in vscode, File->Open folder of only one of the 2 projects.
